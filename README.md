## Silver Tsunami Summary 

The company will need to fill 90,398 roles as the "silver tsunamis" begins to make an impact. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? When it comes to mentoring the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees, the data varies. 

* No retiring Managers are eligible to mentor. This means that at least in regards to Manager roles, the company will have to broaden the criteria a bit. 
* When it comes to Senior Engineers, although there are 317 retiring Senior Engineers eligible for mentoring, the ratio is 1:93 meaning that for every 92 positions opening up there wil be exactly one retiring employee available to mentor the next generation. The ratio is quite high and for rhis reason I think the company needs to expand their criteria a bit more. 
* The title with the most retirees eligible for mentoring is Staff with 1 mentor for eveyr 30 employees. this seems much more reasonable than the ration for Senior Engineer mentoring groups, but still quite high.
